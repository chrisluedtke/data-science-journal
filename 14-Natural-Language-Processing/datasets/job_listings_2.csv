Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why:</div><div><br/>\n</div><div><b>\nA strong founder team</b></div><div>\nWe, the founders, have a proven track record of building successful companies from scratch.

Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for <i>everyone</i> and our team will be working remotely most of the time.\n</div><div></div><br/>\n<div>This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all.
