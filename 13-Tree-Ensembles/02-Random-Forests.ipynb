    ">There are a few things to keep in mind when using the impurity based ranking. Firstly, feature selection based on impurity reduction is biased towards preferring variables with more categories. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Secondly, when the dataset has two (or more) correlated features, then from the point of view of the model, any of these correlated features can be used as the predictor, with no concrete preference of one over the others. But once one of them is used, the importance of others is significantly reduced since effectively the impurity they can remove is already removed by the first feature. As a consequence, they will have a lower reported importance. This is not an issue when we want to use feature selection to reduce overfitting, since it makes sense to remove features that are mostly duplicated by other features. But when interpreting the data, it can lead to the incorrect conclusion that one of the variables is a strong predictor while the others in the same group are unimportant, while actually they are very close in terms of their relationship with the response variable.\n",

    "[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), Chapter 8.2.1, Out-of-Bag Error Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "> It turns out that **there is a very straightforward way to estimate the test error of a bagged model, without the need to perform cross-validation or the validation set approach.** \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Recall that the key to bagging is that trees are repeatedly fit to bootstrapped subsets of the observations. One can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around two-thirds of the observations. The remaining one-third of the **observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the out-of bag (OOB) observations.**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">We can predict the response for the ith observation using each of the trees in which that observation was OOB. This will yield around B/3 predictions for the ith observation. In order to obtain a single prediction for the ith observation, we can average these predicted responses (if regression is the goal) or can take a majority vote (if classification is the goal). \n",
    ">\n",
    ">This leads to a single OOB prediction for the ith observation. An OOB prediction can be obtained in this way for each of the n observations, from which the overall OOB MSE (for a regression problem) or classification error (for a classification problem) can be computed. The resulting **OOB error is a valid estimate of the test error for the bagged model, since the response for each observation is predicted using only the trees that were not fit using that observation.** ... \n",
    ">\n",
    ">It can be shown that with B sufficiently large, OOB error is virtually equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation error. The OOB approach for estimating the test error is particularly **convenient when performing bagging on large data sets for which cross-validation would be computationally onerous.**"

    "[The ELI5 library documentation explains,](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/permutation_importance.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Importance can be measured by looking at how much the score (accuracy, F1, R^2, etc. - any score we’re interested in) decreases when a feature is not available.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To do that one can remove feature from the dataset, re-train the estimator and check the score. But it requires re-training an estimator for each feature, which can be computationally intensive. ...\n",
    ">\n",
    ">To avoid re-training the estimator we can remove a feature only from the test part of the dataset, and compute score without using this feature. It doesn’t work as-is, because estimators expect feature to be present. So instead of removing a feature we can replace it with random noise - feature column is still there, but it no longer contains useful information. This method works if noise is drawn from the same distribution as original feature values (as otherwise estimator may fail). The simplest way to get such noise is to shuffle values for a feature, i.e. use other examples’ feature values - this is how permutation importance is computed.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The method is most suitable for computing feature importances when a number of columns (features) is not huge; it can be resource-intensive otherwise.\n",
