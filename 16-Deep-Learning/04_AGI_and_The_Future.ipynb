    "## Defining Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward definition of Artificial Intelligence would simply be \"intelligence, created from technology rather than biology.\" But that simply raises the question - what is *intelligence*?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early history of computers, this seemed like an easier question. Intelligence meant solving tricky problems - things that took time and mental effort for a human to figure out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined that way, computers have made a litany of intelligent achievements over the years:\n",
    "- Arithmetic\n",
    "- Logic\n",
    "- Chess\n",
    "- Go\n",
    "- StarCraft\n",
    "- Mathematical proofs\n",
    "- Understanding natural language\n",
    "- Generating natural language\n",
    "- Understanding images\n",
    "- Generating images\n",
    "- Making medical diagnoses\n",
    "- Fitting and *optimizing* ML models\n",
    "\n",
    "And many more - every time you fit a simple regression, you're facilitating an act of artificial intelligence. You're writing code that will (hopefully) understand and generalize based on data, giving a \"human-like\" ability to intuit and predict something."

    "![And they both react poorly to showers.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ai.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere that word \"general\" snuck in, and now we're concerned about \"Artificial General Intelligence.\" So, what is that?\n",

    "![Data](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/DataTNG.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration is likely characters such as the above, but that's not a definition. Intuitively the claim is \"computers that can be thrown in a variety of environments and learn without guidance\", but another good definition (based on how people use the term) may simply be \"whatever we haven't figured out how to get computers to do yet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeatedly, claims are made about tasks that will require a \"true AI\" to achieve. Then, when those tasks are completed, the bar is moved, and \"true AI\" is somehow always a bit further off."

    "> This platform focuses not on the this-AI-is-magic-and-can-solve-everything like many AI SaaS startups announced on Hacker News, but focuses on how to actually integrate this AI into production workflows, which is something I wish was discussed more often in AI. -- minimaxir\n",

    "## Automation, for good and ill\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth spending a moment considering the double-edged sword that is automation. This story did not begin with artificial intelligence, or even statistics or mathematics - it began when the first tool inventor figured out how to make something clever like a lever or a wheel, and use it to reduce the amount of labor needed to achieve some task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern day we talk about automation, but in practice most technology is best considered as a *productivity multiplier* - all businesses still need at least *some* humans around, if nothing else to make policy decisions and collect profit. But the productivity of each individual person can be greatly enhanced through the use of technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider farming - formerly a signification source of employment (and also small family owned farms), technology has tranformed it into a large scale industry where a handful of people produce as much as many more did before. This progression has happened in many areas - fortunately, it is usually accompanied by job growth and opportunity as new markets and services are created by technology as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, is it different now? Maybe - \"history will say\" is the only safe stance. But we are automating work at an accelerating rate, and it's unclear where all this growth is going and where the opportunities will be. There's a pretty good bet that it'll involve computers and data - and that's probably a large part of why you're here!\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is not to convince you of anything - it is just to make you think. As a Data Scientist, you will have an outsized impact on society, and it is your responsibility to consider that impact and what you want to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important caveat** - think and engage with society, *but* strive to not be strident or unduly certain when you do so. Broadcasting political beliefs, especially while on the job market, usually closes more doors than it opens. So, consider perspectives, and encourage dialogue - don't just (re)broadcast outrage at the latest injustice."

The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans. — Nick Bostrom\n",

Killer robot armies make for good TV, but at some step there's likely a human with an off switch."
